# RbindertestIR2
This is a test to generate an interactive repository hosted on GitHub.  No software required on guest PC. 
We have an Rstudio Rmkdn Notebook with working code on our PC. This code will be appended to the master branch this RbindertestIR2 skeleton repo. We now have to move this repo to our PC.
